title: Java Programming 0: What Is An Object-Oriented Programming Language
---

Hello! If you're reading this you're hopefully interested in learning Java.

You may be asking yourself what Object-Oriented even means. The definition from Google explains it decently well:
- object-oriented - using a methodology that enables a system to be modeled as a set of objects that can be controlled and manipulated in a modular manner.

I'll explain this further down below.

Java uses a type of programming called Object-Oriented Programming, which basically means you'll be defining everything a class IS. During this tutorial I hope to explain Object-Oriented Programming in detail.

Let's say you have a class named 'Vehicle'. Sure it's named Vehicle, but is it really even a vehicle yet?

For example, a vehicle is a mobile machine that transports people or cargo. Normally under it's own power or an external force, for example, a car or a bicycle. So therefore we need to define all of that inside of the Vehicle class in order for it to be a vehicle.

Now, let's say we have a car and a bicycle. Sure the car and the bicycle both move, but the fact of the matter is the car and the bicycle aren't exactly the same.

Sure they are a vehicle, but they're propelled differently. The car uses its own motor in order to propel itself forward, but a bicycle uses the force from the user pedalling.

Now here's something cool about Java. While the car is a vehicle, a vehicle isn't always a car. This means that the changes we make to the car won't affect any other vehicles. Just because I make a car run on diesel doesn't mean that suddenly a bike runs on diesel.

**However**, if we change the Vehicle class to make it always require vehicles to run on diesel, suddenly all vehicles will run on diesel. However, another c## Java Programming #0: What Is An Object-Oriented Programming Language

**However**, if we change the Vehicle class to make it always require vehicles to run on diesel, suddenly all vehicles will run on diesel. However, another cool thing about Java is the fact we can override values from parent classes. If I really want, I can change the bicycle to not run on any type of fuel. I'd basically be overriding part of what makes the bicycle a vehicle. However, a majority of the bike would still be a vehicle, cause we're only overriding the type of fuel the bicycle uses, not the rest of the bike.

My point is this: You now basically know the 3 things that make an object-oriented programming language.

You understand encapsulation because you **encapsulated** (another word for enclosed) everything about a vehicle into the Vehicle class.

You understand inheritance. The car and bicycle both **inherit** the properties of the Vehicle class.

You even understand polymorphism. While all the vehicles appear different, and they have different properties, they still are all vehicles.

I hope this helped you with understanding what Object-Oriented Programming is. I plan to have more tutorials thatool thing about Java is the fact we can override values from parent classes.
