title: My Interest in Game Development
---

Ever since the age of 5 I've basically always known what I want to do for a career. Recently I've been working on this idea for a new game and I feel like it's a great time to start planning things more thoroughly and focus on getting some prototypes of it.

This project is simply codenamed 'Project Peak'. I hope to bring something interesting for people to enjoy. This project is 2D and top-down and has some roguelike elements, but that isn't its main focus. In the future I hope to provide more information on the project slowly through development blogs and such. I hope you guys are happy with what I reveal over time.

As usual, have a good one!
