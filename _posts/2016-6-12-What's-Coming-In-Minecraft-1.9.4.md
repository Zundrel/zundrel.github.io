title: What's Coming Up in Minecraft 1.9.4 Modding
---

I have many projects coming up for Minecraft 1.9.4 modding actually. I plan to port Simply Paths but seperate the roads into another mod called 'Simply Roads'.

I also have a mod which I can port from 1.7.10 which converts all chat into Olde English which is pretty hilarious imo. It's only required server-side.

I even have some plans to experiment with some agricultural-based mods as well with the trend of those coming lately (e.x. Zoology, Better Agriculture), and also to go with the absence of popular agricultural mods such as AgriCraft.

And as far as magic goes I want to journey into it as well since I haven't really done that before, beyond Interdiction Pillar.

So overall, expect some nice things coming to Minecraft 1.9.4 from me. Have a good one!
